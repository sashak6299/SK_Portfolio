# Welcome.

My name is Sasha Klein. I'm a data analyst based in Washington, DC. I have advanced experience with R, effectively creating a diverse array of visualizations to interpret data.

I'm passionate about applying these modeling and visualization skills to environmental and sustainability focused work.
