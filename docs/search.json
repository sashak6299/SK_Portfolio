    "text": "1 Welcome!\nHello there! I’m Sasha, a current Master’s student of Environment & Sustainability Management at Georgetown University, McDonough School of Business. Since beginning this program, I discovered an unexpected passion for data modeling and visualizations.\nMy strength lies in simplifying complex data into understandable visuals—a skill I’m continually refining through a dedication to learning and adopting the latest methods.\nMy data analysis journey is propelled by a mission to merge data modeling with environmental sustainability. I aim to develop data-driven solutions addressing significant environmental challenges, intending to communicate these insights effectively to prompt policy and behavioral changes towards sustainability.\nMoreover, my focus includes extensive research into the impacts of climate change, exploring mitigation strategies through data modeling and visualization. My goal is to render scientific information accessible to diverse audiences, empowering action across communities and stakeholders.\nHailing from the US Virgin Islands, firsthand experiences with the effects of anthropogenic climate change fuel my unwavering commitment to making a genuine impact. Beyond my professional work, you can find me reading at coffee shops, running, spending time with my dog, and cooking."

    "text": "The project aimed to explore and visualize environmental data related to biomass loss attributed to elephants and other disturbances in plant populations. It involves various tasks like creating new columns, filtering and visualizing data through histograms, scatterplots, bar plots, and predictive modeling. The goal is to understand relationships between elephant density, age categories, biomass loss, and probabilities of significant biomass loss due to disturbances, providing insights into ecological impacts."

This project follows the workflow that is used to craft analyses that can be published in reports or peer-reviewed publications. Further, it focuses on visualizing data from a study on elephant browsing and plant mortality in semi- arid regions of Namibia (Kindermann et al., 2022)"

The boxplot offers insight into response variability, while the jittered points highlight the average proportion loss, providing a comparative view based on Elephant Density and Age Category. The plot aims to reveal potential correlations between Elephant Density, response variation, and disturbance-induced losses among different age groups.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sankey diagram visualizes the flow of biomass proportions across different vegetation types, ages of vegetation, elephant densities, and types of disturbances. It illustrates how biomass distribution changes among savanna and woodland, various age categories, elephant densities, and the relative impact of disturbances like elephants, fire, woodcutting, browsers, abiotic factors, and other unidentified influences on the ecosystem’s biomass loss. The diagram’s nodes and flows showcase the proportional distribution and shifts of biomass among these categories, providing an overview of their interrelationships and impacts within the ecosystem."
