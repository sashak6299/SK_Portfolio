## Project Goal

Our aim is to understand the global influence of different climate disturbances on coral coverage around the world.Â  To craft our visualization, we're drawing from a comprehensive study that compiled research findings on coral cover loss worldwide (Cresswell et al., 2023). Our goal is to capture and illustrate the intricate relationship between climate-induced changes and their impact on coral ecosystems across diverse regions.

## Methods

We produced our visualizations based on a data set about global coral cover before and after certain disturbances such as storms and cyclones, temperature stress and coastal run-off from flooding. We worked on a linear regression and arrived at a final model where the response variable, Impact, depended upon the longitude interacting with disturbance type, the disturbance year and the mean of the coral coverage before the disturbance

## Outputs

The visualization illustrates global impacts on corals categorized by different disturbance types using a bubble map overlaying coral sites across longitude and latitude coordinates. Each bubble's size and color denote the magnitude and variation of disturbances across geographical locations and types.
